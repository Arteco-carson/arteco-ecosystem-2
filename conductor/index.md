# Conductor Index

Welcome to the **Conductor** of the Arteco Ecosystem. This directory serves as the central nervous system for our project, bridging the gap between *Product Vision* and *Technical Execution*.

## 🗺️ Navigation Map

## 🚦 Guardrails for the Product Owner

*   **🟢 Green Files**: These are your domain. Please express your vision, requirements, and user needs here freely.
*   **🟡 Yellow Files**: These are collaborative. We use them to align on *processes* and *priorities*.
*   **🔴 Red Files**: These are technical configurations. Changing them might break the "Engine". Please discuss with Engineering before suggesting changes here.

## 🤖 For the Agent (Me)

*   **Context Resolution**: I use this index to find the source of truth.
*   **Tracks**: I look for detailed plans in `tracks/<track_id>/plan.md`.
