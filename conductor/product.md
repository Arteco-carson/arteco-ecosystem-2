# Product Vision

This document defines the strategic goals of the Arteco Ecosystem.
**Core Philosophy:** One Platform, Multiple Lenses.

## 🌟 The "Unified" Experience
Users should not feel they are "switching apps." They are simply changing their **Lens** on the data.
* **Old World:** Login to ACM -> Manage Art -> Logout -> Login to DR -> Report Defect.
* **New World (The Portal):** User is authenticated *once*. The Sidebar allows instant context switching between "Collection View" (ACM) and "Condition View" (DR).

## 🧠 The AI Concierge
The **OmniBox** (Smart Input) is the primary navigation tool.
* *Input:* "Assess damage on the Warhol."
* *Action:* System deep-links to the Defect Reporting module for that specific asset.

## 👥 User Personas
1.  **The Collector (Ian):** Needs high-level overviews, market news, and rapid "Context Switching."
2.  **The Registrar:** Needs deep-dive data entry in ACM.
3.  **The Conservator:** Needs focused mobile tools for DR (Defect Reporting).
